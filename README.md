📉 Customer Churn Prediction
This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict customer churn for a subscription-based service or business. By analyzing historical customer data including demographics and usage behavior, the goal is to identify customers who are likely to churn, allowing for proactive retention strategies.

🚀 Project Overview
Churn refers to the rate at which customers stop doing business with an entity. Predicting churn is vital for subscription-based businesses to reduce customer loss and improve revenue.

In this project, we:

Perform data cleaning and exploration

Engineer relevant features

Train and evaluate machine learning models

Compare model performance (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

Provide insights for business decision-making

📊 Features Used
Typical features from the dataset include:

Customer Demographics: Age, gender, income, location

Subscription Details: Plan type, subscription length, auto-renew status

Usage Behavior: Login frequency, service usage, support calls

Customer Tenure: How long they've been with the company

Churn (Target): 1 if the customer left, 0 otherwise

🔍 Models Explored
We implemented and compared the following machine learning models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting (XGBoost / LightGBM)

Metrics used:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1 Score

ROC AUC

🧠 Insights & Next Steps
Most churned users had low engagement and short tenure.

High-performing models achieved >85% accuracy.

Churn risk scores can help target at-risk customers for retention offers.

Next steps:

Deploy model as an API

Integrate with CRM tools

Implement A/B testing for retention strategies
